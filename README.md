- Mine Notes, or Hurt Notes
  - A type of note which negatively impacts score when hit, if it's avoided, nothing happens

- Holds, or Sustains
  - Little tails behind a Tap Note which require the player to HOLD the note until the end in order to be hit.

- Rolls
  - quite similar to holds in the way they render, but rather than holding down the note until the end, you must tap repeteadely, preventing the note from fading out, until it ends
