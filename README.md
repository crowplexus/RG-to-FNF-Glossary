## DESCRIPTORS

### Notes

- Holds, or Sustains
  - Little tails behind a Tap Note which require the player to HOLD the note until the end in order to be hit.

- Mines, or Hurt Notes
  - A type of note which negatively impacts score when hit, if it's avoided, nothing happens

- Rolls
  - quite similar to holds in the way they render, but rather than holding down the note until the end, you must tap repeteadely, preventing the note from fading out, until it ends

- Nukes, or Insta-kill Notes
  - It's similar to mines, except they remove a larger chunk of your health while also having the same negative effect in score, as seen in VS Tricky V2, they instantly kill you, but usually when seen in other games that have them, they simply take away a VERY large portion of your health, like 80% for example.

### Charting

- Measures, Bars
  - Measures or Bars, are small chunks of a song composed of a set number of steps, in FNF, the Chart Editor provides you with 16 different squares you can use to place notes, combined with the 4 lanes you usually have, you get 64 slots to place, excluding the second player's side, which would result in 128 slots to place notes on
  - In older versions of Friday Night Funkin', Bars were erroneously called "Sections", which represent a WAY LARGER chunk of the song than just simply 16 steps, however, the term "Section" stuck around for a while, and some engines still call Bars "Sections" - therefore, it is included here.
